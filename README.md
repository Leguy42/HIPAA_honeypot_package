# HIPAA_honeypot_package
A set of files that can be used in creating a honeypot where the defending organization is a healthcare practice subject to HIPAA regulations.
Wherever the company name appears throughout the repository, it just says company name or [company name]. 
It was left that way to enable you to configure those according to your requirements.
You should change it to the name of the medical practice that you're defending with the honeypot.
For the EHR login page to work your host needs to have Flask installed.
